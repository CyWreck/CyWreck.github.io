Financial, healthcare, and retail organizations are all prime targets to hackers daily. When cybercriminals can&rsquo;t get through the cybersecurity infrastructure of an organization, they can try to gain access to your website. Some of the ways they can achieve this include software vulnerability, access control, and third-party integrations like extensions. For content management system platforms like WordPress, which host over 35% of all websites on the internet, 98% of its vulnerabilities come from plugins. That&rsquo;s why there are also tons of security plugins to protect the vulnerable ones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Every 39 seconds, there is a new attack somewhere on the Web.</strong>

That is about 2,244 attacks that happen on the internet daily! That’s how many cyber attacks happen per day. We saw earlier how hackers are creating hundreds of thousands of new malware daily. They are not created to sit idle; they are to be deployed onto the web and penetrate vulnerabilities within specific targets. However, it is also essential to take note that an attack does not necessarily mean a breach. A cyber attack can be successful or unsuccessful, depending on the cybersecurity measure put in place by a target.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hackers breached almost 4 million records in March 2022.</strong>

According to remote cyber attacks statistics, eight in 10 corporate networks utilize internet of things devices. Shockingly, only about 50% of them have the proper infrastructure to protect themselves from hacking. In fact, most of them still use the default password. That poses a massive risk, as data breaches could happen any minute.</p></li><li><p><strong>An average of around 24,000 malicious mobile apps are blocked daily on various mobile app stores.</strong>

A distributed denial of service attack, also known as a DDoS attack, uses multiple systems to flood a particular server with irrelevant requests. This leads to a point when the server in question is unable to process legitimate requests from genuine users. It is simply an attempt by hackers to disrupt the day-to-day operation of a business. The motive behind most DDoS attacks is to obtain ransom from victims. Reports have it that 679,000 DDoS attacks occur monthly, which results in a total of 16 DDoS attacks every minute.</p></li><li><p><strong>There are 65,000 attempts to hack small-medium-sized businesses in the UK daily.</strong>

Statistics on how many cyber attacks per day in the UK report that the country has one of the lowest costs of data breaches compared to the world&rsquo;s average. Also, out of all cyber attacks attempts made daily, 4,500 of them are always successful. The average cost of a data breach in the UK is $3.8 million, lower than the world&rsquo;s average of $3.92 million. That said, if you live or operate a business in the UK, you might want to consider getting a better AV solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>64% of companies worldwide have experienced at least one form of cyber attack in the past year.</strong>

There are countless reasons why hackers would want to attack a business. Stealing business financial details, customer financial details, espionage, etc., are among the top reasons hackers attack online businesses. Some of the most popular forms of cyberattacks mostly utilized by these cyber attackers are; phishing, malware, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, and more attacks.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Industries and Businesses Cyber Attack Statistics</strong></p><p>Though individuals and businesses are both prime targets of cyber attacks, the frequency of attacks on businesses (especially small ones) far outweighs that of individuals. Here, we take a look at some of the industry statistics on cyber attack on small businesses worldwide:</p><ol start=21><li><p><strong>In 2022, 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses.</strong>
(Source: Forbes) According to Forbes, only 14% of these companies have proper defenses. And 83% aren’t financially prepared to recover from such attacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>IoT devices suffer approximately 5,200 attacks per month.</strong>

By the end of 2021,up to 37% of all businesses were hit by ransomware. 2022 cyberattack statistics show that ransomware alone had cost the world about $20 billion. Experts estimate that this amount will hit $265 billion by 2031.</p></li><li><p><strong>As of Q1 of 2022, The highest number of DDoS attacks comes from China.</strong>
(Source: GovTech) According to China’s cyberattack statistics, the country is the highest originator of DDoS attacks in the world. The United States follows closely behind, while Brazil comes third.</p><p>One of the most recent and notable DDoS attacks occurred in January 2022 when North Korea’s internet was crippled. This attack lasted for six hours and all traffic to and from the country was taken down.</p></li><li><p><strong>Windows is the most vulnerable Operating system (OS) for ransomware.</strong>
Source: (Safety Detectives) Ransomware is likely to affect eight in 10 Windows machines. In contrast, only 7% of macOS devices have the same problem. The Operating system that is less likely to get such an infection is iOS with 3%.</p></li><li><p><strong>53% of Canadian companies that experienced ransomware paid the hackers.</strong>
