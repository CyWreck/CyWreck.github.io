At Cywreck, we understand that cybersecurity isn't just about technology â€“ it's about protecting your business. In today's digital world, even minor vulnerabilities in infrastructure, DevOps practices, and code reviews can have a domino effect, leading to significant financial losses.

This newsletter explores the cost of cyberattacks stemming from these issues, providing insights on how to strengthen your defenses.

## The Infrastructure Gap:
- **Cost of a Data Breach:** According to IBM, the global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was a staggering $4.35 million ([Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach)).

- **The Infrastructure Factor:** Outdated or poorly maintained infrastructure creates security gaps that attackers exploit. A Ponemon Institute report revealed that 63% of security breaches involved vulnerabilities in unpatched systems ([Ponemon](https://www.ponemon.org/)).

## DevOps Security Concerns:
- **The Speed vs. Security Conundrum:** The pressure for rapid deployments in DevOps environments can lead to security being overlooked. A study by Veracode found that 84% of organizations have experienced a security incident due to a vulnerability in a custom application ([Addressing the Threat
of Security Debt](https://www.veracode.com/state-software-security-2024-report)).

- **The Cost of Insecure Applications:** These vulnerabilities translate into financial losses. Positive Technologies estimates that insecure software costs businesses an average of $1.3 trillion globally each year ([Positive Technologies](https://global.ptsecurity.com/)).

## The Code Review Conundrum:
- **Human Error's High Price Tag:** According to Experian, human error is a factor in over 90% of data breaches ([5 Shocking Data Breach Statistics and Why Your Company Needs Protection Now](https://www.experian.com/blogs/data-breach/2022/03/14/5-shocking-data-breach-stats-and-why-your-company-needs-protection-now/)). Inadequate code reviews can leave vulnerabilities undetected.

- **The Cost of Code Defects:** A study by CAST Software found that poor code quality can cost businesses an average of $140,000 per application per year ([Cast Software](https://www.castsoftware.com/)). These defects can be exploited by attackers, leading to financial losses.

## Building a Robust Defense:
Here's how Cywreck can help you mitigate these risks:
- **Vulnerability Assessments & Penetration Testing:** Identify and address weaknesses in your infrastructure before attackers do.
- **DevSecOps Integration:** Weave security into your DevOps pipeline for secure and rapid deployments.
- **Secure Code Reviews:** Our experts identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your code, reducing the attack surface.

By investing in a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, you can prevent costly cyberattacks and protect your bottom line.

**Don't let vulnerabilities in your infrastructure, DevOps practices, or code reviews become a financial burden.**

Our Wreckbot AI solves just these issues and more!
