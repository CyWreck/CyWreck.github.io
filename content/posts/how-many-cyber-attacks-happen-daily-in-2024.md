   Cyber attack stats for 2022 show that opening emails containing file extensions like .iso, .exe, .zip, .dmg, .rar should be avoided. Zip. and jar. files can easily bypass the anti-malware security of most email providers, so be on the lookout for them. Microsoft Office files could also pose a threat. Since most people are used to extensions like .ppt, .doc, and .xls, they’re easy to overlook.

4. **The average cost of a data breach in 2022 was over $3.80 million.**
   (Source: Cybercrime Magazine)
   2022 data breach report from IBM shows that companies spent up to $3.80 million per data breach in 2022.

5. **Uber reportedly lost the information of 57 million riders and drivers after a data breach in 2016.**
   (Source: Tech Crunch)
   The Uber data breach occurred in 2016 with more than 600,000 drivers having their license numbers and names exposed to hackers. According to cyber attack statistics, this attack represents one of the most significant data breaches in recent times. What’s more, Uber did pay off its hackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data. However, word came out about a year later after the attempt proved unsuccessful. Following this, Uber had to pay a sum of $148 million to settle a nationwide investigation into the data breach.

Quite fascinating, right? But that's not all - if you are interested in more curious facts about the ride-hailing company, you can check out our Uber statistics list.

12. **Globally, 30,000 websites are hacked daily.**
    (Source: Web Arx Security)
    Financial, healthcare, and retail organizations are all prime targets to hackers daily. When cybercriminals can't get through the cybersecurity infrastructure of an organization, they can try to gain access to your website. Some of the ways they can achieve this include software vulnerability, access control, and third-party integrations like extensions. For content management system platforms like WordPress, which host over 35% of all websites on the internet, 98% of its vulnerabilities come from plugins. That's why there are also tons of security plugins to protect the vulnerable ones.

13. **Every 39 seconds, there is a new attack somewhere on the Web.**
    (Source: University of Maryland)
    That is about 2,244 attacks that happen on the internet daily! That’s how many cyber attacks happen per day. We saw earlier how hackers are creating hundreds of thousands of new malware daily. They are not created to sit idle; they are to be deployed onto the web and penetrate vulnerabilities within specific targets. However, it is also essential to take note that an attack does not necessarily mean a breach. A cyber attack can be successful or unsuccessful, depending on the cybersecurity measure put in place by a target.

14. **Hackers breached almost 4 million records in March 2022.**
    (Source: IT Governance)

18. **23,000 DDoS attacks are happening somewhere on the internet every 24 hours.**
    (Source: Net Scout)
    A distributed denial of service attack, also known as a DDoS attack, uses multiple systems to flood a particular server with irrelevant requests. This leads to a point when the server in question is unable to process legitimate requests from genuine users. It is simply an attempt by hackers to disrupt the day-to-day operation of a business. The motive behind most DDoS attacks is to obtain ransom from victims. Reports have it that 679,000 DDoS attacks occur monthly, which results in a total of 16 DDoS attacks every minute.

19. **There are 65,000 attempts to hack small-medium-sized businesses in the UK daily.**

    Statistics on how many cyber attacks per day in the UK report that the country has one of the lowest costs of data breaches compared to the world's average. Also, out of all cyber attacks attempts made daily, 4,500 of them are always successful. The average cost of a data breach in the UK is $3.8 million, lower than the world's average of $3.92 million. That said, if you live or operate a business in the UK, you might want to consider getting a better AV solution.

20. **64% of companies worldwide have experienced at least one form of cyber attack in the past year.**
    (Source: Cybint Solutions)
    There are countless reasons why hackers would want to attack a business. Stealing business financial details, customer financial details, espionage, etc., are among the top reasons hackers attack online businesses. Some of the most popular forms of cyberattacks mostly utilized by these cyber attackers are; phishing, malware, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, and more attacks.

**Industries and Businesses Cyber Attack Statistics**

Though individuals and businesses are both prime targets of cyber attacks, the frequency of attacks on businesses (especially small ones) far outweighs that of individuals. Here, we take a look at some of the industry statistics on cyber attack on small businesses worldwide:

21. **In 2022, 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses.**
    (Source: Forbes) According to Forbes, only 14% of these companies have proper defenses. And 83% aren’t financially prepared to recover from such attacks.

22. **IoT devices suffer approximately 5,200 attacks per month.**
    (Source: Forbes)
    That’s largely due to IoT devices still being in their infancy stage – thus lacking the necessary level of security to deter cyber attacks.

23. **63% of all organizational internal data breach is a result of compromised usernames and passwords.**
    (Source: ID Agent)
    In the journey of online security, deploying a strong password system is your first line of defense against cyber attackers, irrespective of what device you are trying to protect. cyberattacks statistics reveal that the lack of employee cybersecurity training causes workers to use weak and predictable passwords such as "12345", "QWERTY," etc.

    In its research, Microsoft found that 73% of people online use duplicate passwords across various platforms, thereby leaving themselves exposed to a possible data breach.

    That's why you should consider creating a strong password, or better yet - use a password manager.

24. **74% of organizations worldwide claim they are susceptible to insider threats.**
    (Source: Bitglass)
    We pay so much attention to threats posed by external hackers, forgetting that insider threats are as dangerous to us as those we receive from outside sources. Statistics on malicious cyberattacks revealed that insider threats caused 60 % of all data breaches for the year.

    Insider threats can come from malicious/careless workers, inside agents, third-party users/contractors, and even disgruntled employees.

25. **By 2031, ransomware will cost the world up to $265 billion.**
    (Source: Forbes)
    By the end of 2021,up to 37% of all businesses were hit by ransomware. 2022 cyberattack statistics show that ransomware alone had cost the world about $20 billion. Experts estimate that this amount will hit $265 billion by 2031.

26. **As of Q1 of 2022, The highest number of DDoS attacks comes from China.**
    (Source: GovTech) According to China’s cyberattack statistics, the country is the highest originator of DDoS attacks in the world. The United States follows closely behind, while Brazil comes third.

    One of the most recent and notable DDoS attacks occurred in January 2022 when North Korea’s internet was crippled. This attack lasted for six hours and all traffic to and from the country was taken down.

27. **Windows is the most vulnerable Operating system (OS) for ransomware.**
    Source: (Safety Detectives) Ransomware is likely to affect eight in 10 Windows machines. In contrast, only 7% of macOS devices have the same problem. The Operating system that is less likely to get such an infection is iOS with 3%.

28. **53% of Canadian companies that experienced ransomware paid the hackers.**
    (Source: Blakes)
    Despite warnings by the government not to comply, more than half of the companies that hackers targeted paid the ransom, businesses cyber attacks statistics show. Organizations dealing with professional financial and healthcare services suffered the most breaches.
